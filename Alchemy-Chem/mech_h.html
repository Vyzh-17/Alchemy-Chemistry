const questions = [
  {
    question: "You are tasked with selecting a battery for a **high-performance electric vehicle** (EV) that needs to provide **high energy density** and support **fast charging**. Which battery chemistry would be the most suitable?",
    options: ["A) Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)", "B) Lead-Acid", "C) Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd)", "D) Sodium-Ion"],
    answer: "A) Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)",
    explanation: "Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries provide the highest **energy density** and **fast charging** capabilities, making them ideal for modern **electric vehicles**. They are lighter and more efficient compared to lead-acid or nickel-cadmium batteries."
  },
  {
    question: "You are working with a **solar power storage system** that needs a **longer lifespan** and moderate energy density. Which battery type would you choose for the application?",
    options: ["A) Lead-Acid", "B) Lithium-Ion", "C) Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)", "D) Zinc-Air"],
    answer: "A) Lead-Acid",
    explanation: "Lead-Acid batteries, while not having the highest energy density, are well-known for their **long lifespan** and reliability, making them an affordable choice for **solar power storage systems**."
  },
  {
    question: "You are designing a **portable electronic device** and need a **rechargeable battery** with **low cost**, **good discharge efficiency**, and **a stable voltage output**. Which battery would you recommend?",
    options: ["A) Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)", "B) Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd)", "C) Lead-Acid", "D) Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)"],
    answer: "D) Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)",
    explanation: "Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries are a **good balance** between **cost**, **discharge efficiency**, and **voltage stability**, making them ideal for **portable electronic devices** like cameras or radios."
  },
  {
    question: "In an industrial electrolysis process, you are asked to calculate the mass of copper deposited at the cathode when a current of 2 A is passed for 10 minutes. According to **Faraday's law of electrolysis**, what factor is most important in determining the amount of copper deposited?",
    options: ["A) The current", "B) The voltage applied", "C) The time the current flows", "D) The temperature of the solution"],
    answer: "A) The current",
    explanation: "According to **Faraday's law**, the amount of substance deposited during electrolysis is directly proportional to the **current** and the **time** the current flows. The voltage affects the process but is not the primary factor."
  },
  {
    question: "You are working with a **hydrogen fuel cell** in a **vehicle**. What is the most significant product generated in the fuel cell after the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen?",
    options: ["A) Water", "B) Carbon Dioxide", "C) Methane", "D) Nitrogen Oxides"],
    answer: "A) Water",
    explanation: "A **hydrogen fuel cell** generates **water** as its primary product when hydrogen reacts with oxygen. This makes fuel cells an environmentally friendly option for clean energy generation in vehicles."
  },
  {
    question: "During electrolysis of water, what happens at the **anode**?",
    options: ["A) Oxygen gas is produced", "B) Hydrogen gas is produced", "C) Water is consumed", "D) Sodium hydroxide is formed"],
    answer: "A) Oxygen gas is produced",
    explanation: "During the electrolysis of water, **oxygen gas** is produced at the **anode** and **hydrogen gas** at the cathode. This process splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen."
  },
  {
    question: "You are studying the **corrosion of iron** in a **marine environment**. What is the primary factor contributing to the acceleration of corrosion in this case?",
    options: ["A) High temperature", "B) Presence of water and oxygen", "C) Low temperature", "D) High pH of the environment"],
    answer: "B) Presence of water and oxygen",
    explanation: "Corrosion of iron is accelerated in **marine environments** because of the high **concentration of water and oxygen**. Saltwater acts as an electrolyte, allowing the electrochemical corrosion process to occur more rapidly."
  },
  {
    question: "You are tasked with protecting a **steel structure** from corrosion. Which method would be the most effective for long-term protection?",
    options: ["A) Galvanizing (coating with zinc)", "B) Applying a plastic coating", "C) Using stainless steel", "D) Regular cleaning and oiling"],
    answer: "A) Galvanizing (coating with zinc)",
    explanation: "**Galvanizing** involves coating steel with a layer of zinc, which provides **sacrificial protection**. Zinc corrodes first, preventing the underlying steel from rusting. This method is highly effective for long-term protection."
  },
  {
    question: "You are working with a **lead-acid battery** in an emergency backup system. What is the primary disadvantage of using this type of battery for the application?",
    options: ["A) Low energy density", "B) High cost", "C) Toxicity of lead", "D) Short lifespan"],
    answer: "C) Toxicity of lead",
    explanation: "One of the primary disadvantages of **lead-acid batteries** is the **toxicity of lead**, which poses environmental and health risks during disposal or leakage, making them less ideal for certain applications despite their affordability."
  },
  {
    question: "You are conducting a **corrosion prevention experiment** and apply a **sacrificial anode** to protect a pipeline. Which material would be most suitable for the sacrificial anode?",
    options: ["A) Zinc", "B) Copper", "C) Aluminum", "D) Iron"],
    answer: "A) Zinc",
    explanation: "A **sacrificial anode** is made of a material more **electrochemically reactive** than the material being protected. Zinc is commonly used for sacrificial anodes because it corrodes in place of the protected material, preventing the pipeline from corroding."
  },
  {
    question: "You are designing a **fuel cell** for use in a **remote research station**. What is the main advantage of using a fuel cell over traditional batteries in this application?",
    options: ["A) Fuel cells can be recharged easily", "B) Fuel cells produce less heat", "C) Fuel cells provide a continuous power supply as long as fuel is available", "D) Fuel cells are cheaper to operate"],
    answer: "C) Fuel cells provide a continuous power supply as long as fuel is available",
    explanation: "**Fuel cells** provide **continuous power** as long as fuel (hydrogen or methanol) is supplied. Unlike batteries, which eventually run out of charge, fuel cells offer a long-term energy source, making them ideal for remote, off-grid applications."
